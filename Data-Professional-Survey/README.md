# Data Professional Survey Dashboard  

## 📋 **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes survey data from data professionals to uncover trends in demographics, salaries, and satisfaction levels. It demonstrates data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in Power BI.  

## 🛠️ **Steps Completed**  

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**  
- Removed unnecessary columns to focus on relevant data.  
- Processed columns with multiple options (e.g., profession, industry, programming language) for better visualization by splitting text and standardizing values.  
- Transformed salary ranges into numerical averages to enable meaningful visualizations.  
- Ensured data integrity by replacing inconsistent values (e.g., "+" in salary ranges).  

### 2. **Data Transformation**  
- Used Power Query for splitting, replacing, and averaging salary data.  
- Created custom columns for calculations.  
- Converted text data to appropriate numeric types for analysis.
